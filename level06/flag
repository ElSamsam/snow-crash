Notes:
    php ?
    preg_replace()
    _
    nm -u level06 shows execve and mandem libc functions
    _
    trying to insert `getflag` somewhere in level06.php args
    
    program looks for an `x` variable
    After looking at php syntax online we came up with this: 
    `[x {${system(getflag)}}]`
    And it works!?
    Using `system()` here since `execve()` did not work, it is php not c
