Notes:
    Exploit binary file how?
    how to access content?
    `cat` shows binary, as expected
    Maybe `gdb`? If it's in C*
    _
    also `nm -u` to see functions called in program
    output:
    `    w _Jv_RegisterClasses
         w __gmon_start__
         U __libc_start_main@@GLIBC_2.0
         U getegid@@GLIBC_2.0
         U geteuid@@GLIBC_2.0
         U setresgid@@GLIBC_2.0
         U setresuid@@GLIBC_2.0
         U system@@GLIBC_2.0
    `
    *It's C yihaa
    _
    `nm` shows:
    `
    [...]
    08048480 t frame_dummy
        U getegid@@GLIBC_2.0
        U geteuid@@GLIBC_2.0
    080484a4 T main
        U setresgid@@GLIBC_2.0
        U setresuid@@GLIBC_2.0
        U system@@GLIBC_2.0
    `
    I guess we're looking at `setresgid` and `setresuid` more specifically
    _
    Inside `gdb ./level03`
    `run` gives : `Exploit me`
    `list` won't work since program isn't called 'level03.c'
    _
    `layour src` or `CTRL + X then A` to open TUI mode or start with `gdb -tui`
    _
    `disas main` shows us assembler dump of main
    `layout next` to inspect in top part of gdb window
